# Neo-Riemannian Player

This is a refactored version of [this repository](https://github.com/Roy-j-Xu/ChordVisualization), and is still in the state of testing.

## Roadmap

1. **[checked]** Learn [iced](https://iced.rs/) framework
2. **[checked?]** Find a suitable structure for multi-threading-supporting note states
3. **[checkde]** Implement standard operations on note states
4. **[ongoing]** Find an algebra-geometry relation between states and Tonnetz. This time, try to avoid using graph data structure
5. Define Tonnetz and dual-Tonnetz
6. Recreate algebraic-BFS from the [previous repository](https://github.com/Roy-j-Xu/ChordVisualization)
7. Plot note state with iced
8. UI design
